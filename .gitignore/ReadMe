Voodoo
The best cure for one's bad tendencies is to see them in action in another person. Voodoo is a family-friendly solution for a social problem: Cursing applicable on google home. you donâ€™t need to buy any hardware!

Inspiration:
Americans used to have this way of raising their kids, whenever one of them curse, they take away one dollar from them, put it in a jar. So basically Voodoo is the modern way to that!

What it does?
Voodoo is a google home app that detects voice, whenever someone curse Voodoo hears it, and reply a notification: One dollar deducted, Voodoo is connected to the user's e-wallet and the Saudi social charity fund bank account, so it deducts the money from the person's account, and donate it to a charity.
